<h1 align="center">Logo Design</h1>

A personal logo for a designer is really important as it presents the designer's style, choices, and what he is capable of. And most importantly, it helps to build an early perspective by a potential client.

I've always wanted my logo to have a signature design similar to the senior designers and painters. However, as I delved into the design, I wanted it to be grounded in a conceptual idea that could be developed from scratch. Ultimately, I will be ale to present a final version that I can be proud of.

The logo idea is based on a combination between the first two letters from the name "Mohamed MAZOUZ" “M M” in the form of a simple and remarkable symbol based on a minimal style. And supported by a collection of colors that will demonstrate clearly the combination between the two letters M M

* The blue represents the cold colors.
* The yellow represents the warm colors.
* The dark blue for the for the remaining components

The idea is to create a chromatic balance between the two colors categories and most importantly to make the letters combination clear and significant to the viewer.

<h1 align="center"> Main LOGO</h1>

A big emphasis has been placed on the logo icon in order to come up with well-balanced and adjusted logo. And mabove all, I'll be able to present this particular logo in various scenarios.

The following list contains: 
* Logo symbol
* The logo symbol with all the grid adjustments 
* The final sketching draft of the logo symbol

<h1 align="center">Logo Sketches</h1>

As a junior designer, I wanted my logo idea to be based on a concept that could be developed from scratch in order to create a meaningful logo that would make viewers think and understand it easily.
As shown in the presented sketches, the logo icon has three components; each one of them contains two shapes. 

Starting from the right side: 
* The first two components refer to the M letter from the first name.
* Whereas, the third one refers to the the M letter from the surname, but hidden in back 
This is supported with three main colors in order to make the merge smooth, clear ,and understandable to the viewers.

<h1 align="center">Logo font typography style</h1>

When it comes to the chosen font typography, the full name is included at the bottom of the logo in order to identify the meaning behind the two letters M M using a basic and simple font typography with a view to maintain the viewers attention and focus on the main logo symbol.

The first name is in bold font style, whereas the surname is in a regular style. The main idea behind this is to make the two words significant beside the main logo symbol with a view to make all of them  integrated component.

<h1 align="center">Logo inspiration</h1>
During the process of designing this particular logo, I had the chance to diversify my inspiration area not only to determine the logo style, but also to be able design this logo as I imagined it.

Being a junior designer, I've been always interested in designs that were inspired whether from nature or human action or even closer to real use. Although, I have been attracted by the material design which is one of the design languages developed by the Google design team. I like the fact that material design focuses on small details when it comes to shaps, shadows, bold flat colors, and most importantly the realistic appearances that provide visual cues inspired from reality and nature.

I like the shadow presences in Material design logos especially on Gmail, Drive, and Calendar logos. This gives a sense of reality and adaptation in the real world.
The balance between the cold and warm colors is also there and supported by small shapes of dark colors from the same colors palette; which provides a sense of comfort to the viewers.

Also, I'm a big fan of the minimal design style. I enjoy the simplicity provided in these material design logos. I would like to use them as a reference and a personal style in my future designs.

> Beside the Material design style, I also looked at Neumorphic Design style which appears to be closer to the 3D design. According to (Noe, R., 2020) it is expected to be raised and supported by Apple's new operating system (Big Sur). This will enhance the realistic aspect in the design style using several cues grounded from reality.

When it comes to the used colors, I wanted to use multiple colors in order to demonstrate the merge among the logo elements. That was inspired from the bold colors especially flat color and Material color palette.

The idea behind this is to create a chromatic balance between the two colors categories and most importantly to make the letters combination clear and significant to the viewer.

<h1 align="center">Logo on mockup</h1>

In order to give and present a realistic view of the future usage to this particular logo, we have used a number of mockups to show potential usage in different perspectives.

* Business card mockup: This shows the logo in a vertical card using the horizontal logo to fit the card layout including the personal links on Behance and Dribbble for business inquiries. Whereas at the back, the logo symbol has been centralized to fit the back of the card.
* White paper mockup: In this mockup, the logo is presented in white background paper in which the logo is expected to be printed repeatedly similar to this format.
* Computer mockup: this shows the expected format of the logo on the computer browser.
* Wallpaper mockup: this one is similar to the white paper mockup, but with a 3D view.

It is expected that this logo is going to be used mostly on digital devices. However, all the criteria for printing usage are already presented in the style guide sheet.


![Style guide](/imgs/section5.jpg)
<h1 align="center">Style guide</h1>

As shown on the logo style guide, these are the criteria in which the logo must be presented whether we want to print it or present it on visual devices. 
All the criteria and the details provided on the style guide must be followed, respected, and most importantly considered as a reference whenever the logo is going to be used. 

The style guide demonstrates the following criteria:
* The three logo versions
* Logo Combination Mark vertical
* Logo Combination Mark horizontal
* Logo symbol
* The original colors codes / main color & monochrome color
* The used font typography / word mark

In this way, the logo format can be maintained and there won’t be any sort of confusion in the future usage. Since the logo is going to be used mostly on digital devices, we didn't want to go deeper in the style guide and provide so many criteria and probabilities of use.

The style guide can only be edited or changed by the original designer or in case there is a major update to the logo with a new style and look.
