<h1 align="center">Logo Design</h1>

A personal logo for a designer is quite important as it presents the designer's style, choices, and what he is capable of, and most importantly it helps to build an early perspective by a potential client.

I always wanted the logo idea to be based on a concept that could be developed from scratch. However, as I delved into the design, I wanted it to be grounded in a conceptual idea that could be developed from scratch. Ultimately, to be able to make a final version that I can be proud of.

The logo idea is based on a combination between the first two letters from the name "Mohamed MAZOUZ" “M M” in the form of a simple and remarkable symbol based on a minimal style. And supported by a collection of colors that will demonstrate clearly the combination between the two letters M M

* The blue which represents the cold colors.
* The yellow which represents the warm colors.
* The dark blue for the for the remaining components

The idea is to create a chromatic balance between the two colors categories and most importantly to make the letters combination clear and significant to the viewer.

<h1 align="center"> Main LOGO</h1>

Big emphasis has been placed on the logo icon in order to come up with a well-balanced and adjusted logo. And most importantly, to be able to present this particular logo in various scenarios.

The following list contain: 
* Logo symbol
* The logo symbol with all the grid adjustments 
* The final sketching draft of the logo symbol

<h1 align="center">Logo Sketches</h1>

I always wanted the logo idea to be based on a concept that could be developed from scratch in order to create a meaningful logo that would make viewers think about and understand it easily.
As shown in the presented sketches, the logo symbol has three components; each one of them contains two shapes. 

Starting from the right side: 
* The first two components refer to the M letter from the first name.
* Whereas, the third one refers to the the M letter from the surname, but hidden in back 
This is supported with three main colors in order to make the merge smooth and clear to the viewers.

<h1 align="center">Logo font typography style</h1>

When it comes to the chosen font typography, the full name has been included at the bottom of the logo in order to identify the meaning behind the two letters M M using a basic and simple font typography with a view to maintain the logo viewers attention and focus on the main logo symbol.

The first name is in bold font style, whereas the surname in a regular style. The main idea behind this is to make the two words significant beside the main logo symbol with a view to make all of them visually integral components.

<h1 align="center">Logo on mockup</h1>

In order to give and present a realistic view of the future usage to this particular logo, we have used a number of mockups to show potential usage in different perspectives.

Business card mockup: This shows the logo in a vertical card using the horizontal logo to fit the card layout including the personal links on Behance and Dribbble for business inquiries. Whereas at the back, the logo symbol has been centralized to fit the back of the card.
White paper mockup: In this mockup, the logo is presented in white background paper in which the logo is expected to be printed repeatedly similar to this format.
Computer mockup: this shows the expected format of the logo on the computer browser.
Wallpaper mockup: this one is similar to the white paper mockup, but with a 3D view.

It is expected that this logo is going to be used mostly on digital devices. However, all the criteria for printing usage are already presented in the style guide sheet.


![Style guide](/imgs/section5.jpg)
<h1 align="center">Style guide</h1>

As shown on the logo style guide, these are the criteria in which the logo must be presented whether we want to print it or present it on visual devices. 
All the criteria and the details provided on the style guide must be followed, respected, and most importantly considered as a reference whenever the logo is going to be used. 

The style guide demonstrates the following criteria:
* The three logo versions
* Logo Combination Mark vertical
* Logo Combination Mark horizontal
* Logo symbol
* The original colors codes / main color & monochrome color
* The used font typography / word mark

In this way, the logo format can be maintained and there won’t be any sort of confusion in the future usage. Since the logo is going to be used mostly on digital devices, we didn't want to go deeper in the style guide and provide so many criteria and probabilities of use.

The style guide can only change by the original designer or in case there is a major update to the logo with new style and look.
